# VProfile-Project-Setup
In this project I will be setting up Multi Tier Web Application Stack for a socal networking site. The stack is written by developers in Java language.
Setup will be locally on my machine.

PROJECT SCENARIO:
Working on a project with variety of services such as Memcached, MySQL, Nginx etc. There is a runbook to setup these services but I'm not comfortable in making changes in the real servers. I will like to setup all the stacks locally on virtual machines. However, the local setup is complex, time consuming and not repeatable. 

SOLUTION:
We can have a local setup but it would be automated, repeatable. I will use Infrastructure as code (IAAC) to complete this.

TOOLS:
1. Hypervisor: Oracle VM VirtualBox
2. Automation: Vagrant
3. CLI: Git Bash
4. IDE: Vscode

OBJECTIVES:
1. Setup VMs locally.
2. Baseline for upcoming projects
3. Real World project setup locally (for R & d)

ARCHITECTURE OF PROJECT SERVICES:
1. NGINX
2. TOMCAT
3. RABBITMQ
4. MEMCACHED
5. MYSQL

ARCHITECTURE OF AUTOMATED SETUP:
1. VAGRANT
2. VIRTUAL BOX
3. GITBASH
